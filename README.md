# Cathy's Learning journal

## Introduction

Hello!  I have worked in public service for over 15 years in the court system, the last few years in a management role.  After reaching my goal of being an administrator, I realized this career path was not for me!  So here I am, learning code and hoping for a change :paw_prints:   

## Growth Mindset

*Challenges, Obstacles, Effort, Criticism, Success of Others*

I was thrown into a growth mindset and left to sink or swim as a new administrator.  I suddenly had to go from my very comfortable position of being behind the scenes and an anonymous face in the crowd to leading the crowd and being responsible for the well-being of that entire audience!  

Our work here is very much procedures based - you follow it and don't deviate.  While this is in part true, there is a danger of just going through the motions and never deviating from that course or finding ways to improve it or yourself.  Growth  mindset is recognizing when you're in that rut of "lather, rinse, repeat" and making an effort to take a step back and re-evaluate, even if that means taking a break or asking for help.  The most invaluable aspect of developing a growth mindset was having a mentor - someone who could offer that outside opinion, honest criticism and push you to grow. 

## Top 3 Reminders to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset

- [x] Be honest with yourself and your team if you are struggling or don't know how to do something.
