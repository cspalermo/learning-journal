# Choose a Text Editor

- Pre-installed text editors: Text Edit and Notepad
  
  These two mentioned are the bare bones of a text editor and do not come many of the useful features of the more elaborate editors, such as themes, syntax highlighting, and no code completing.  

- So Many Options!

 *Notepad, Text Wrangler/BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Brackets*
