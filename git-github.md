# Git Intro

*Lessons Learned Today*

- Have a solid grasp of the terminal and its functions 
- a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)allows multiple developers together and keep track/saves of changes and create mirror repositories to lessen the loss of information.
- Snapshots in time; has a label that points to it w/messages
- Special label called "Head" that means "You Are Here"
- pay attention to detail, spacing of commands and make a cheat sheet of commands.  There is a lot to absorb today :(  

Allows you to download files to your desktop, work on it and push it up to GitHub with all changes tracked so others can see what changes have been made and work on the same project.

## Git works in the background, like a secret receipt we are not allowed to see!  Just enjoy the bakery. ##
