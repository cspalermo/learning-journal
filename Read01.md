# Reflection and Discussion: Read 01

Day 1 of Code 102

Our first day of Code 102 was today! It was an introductory class to the location, instructor and TA and an overview of the systems we will be using: Canvas - an online classroom platform to keep track of assignment, submit them, take quizzes, etc.; Slack - a messaging system to communicate with our instructors and fellow students; and GitHub - a place to make our first repository/website and where we can type code and test it out. We learned how to apply MarkDown concepts to our code to change formating and manipulate different parts of our brand new website. üëç

This is my first real delve into the coding world and I admit, I am getting those flutters of panic feelings even though a theme mentioned throughout the course is that you will get comfortable with being uncomfortable. My biggest worry is how to fit school and homework into the work week (as I am sneaking on a work computer to type this!). üòü
